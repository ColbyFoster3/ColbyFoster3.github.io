    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Colby and I am a Software Developer passionate about all things software. My areas of proficiency include web development, 
        RESTful APIs, backend development, testing and testing methodologies, data transfer protocols, data CRUD operations, and Agile practices.
        I am eager to use my skills to benefit my team and value continuous learning to stay sharp in this evolving industry.
    </p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
        I am a graduate of the University of New Brunswick's 
        <a href="https://www.unb.ca/academics/calendar/undergraduate/current/frederictonprograms/bachelorofscienceinsoftwarenegineering.html">Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering</a> 
        program, which is recognized as an Engineering program. I attended the University for five years, from September 2019 to April 2024, 
        and during that time I participated in the Faculty of Computer Science's 
        <a href="https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/cs/coop/">Co-op program</a>, 
        where I accrued 19 months of professional work experience in addition to the education I received.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Software Engineering program educates students on a variety of concepts that include software implementation (application and web-based), design practices and patterns, 
        hardware implementation, software lifecycle, teamwork and communication, agile practices, etc.
        This program allowed me to work on many projects of differing complexities in teams of varying skill and size. This experience has permitted me to hone my technical and soft 
        skills which has made me a better professional. 
    </p>

        <h3>Final Senior Design Project</h3>

        <p class="container-text">
            This project is the final design project that my team and I completed over eight months for our degrees. It is a point-of-sale (POS) web application to help 
            small businesses revolutionize their systems and quicken their day-to-day workflow. The system is built using the MERN stack, including MongoDB, Express.js, 
            React, and Node.js. My role for the project was creating the backend and data models to support the application functions. Click the image or
