    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Colby and I am a Software Developer looking for a Developer position in the Software Industry. My areas of proficiency include web development, 
        RESTful APIs, backend development, testing and testing methodologies, HTTP, relational database and querying, and Agile practices. 
        Throughout this website, I will showcase more about myself and my skills.
    </p>

    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>
        I am a graduate of the University of New Brunswick's 
        <a href="https://www.unb.ca/academics/calendar/undergraduate/current/frederictonprograms/bachelorofscienceinsoftwarenegineering.html">Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering</a> 
        program, which is recognized as an Engineering program from <a href="https://www.apegnb.com/">APEGNB</a>. I attended the University for five years, from September 2019 to April 2024. 
        During my degree, I participated in the Faculty of Computer Science's 
        <a href="https://www.unb.ca/fredericton/cs/coop/">Co-op program</a> 
        , where I accrued 16 months of professional work experience in addition to the education I received.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Software Engineering program educates students on a variety of concepts that include software implementation (application and web-based), design practices and patterns, 
        hardware implementation, software lifecycle, teamwork and communication, agile practices, etc.
        This program allowed me to work on many projects of differing complexities in teams of varying skill and size. This experience has permitted me to hone my technical and soft 
        skills which has made me a better professional.
